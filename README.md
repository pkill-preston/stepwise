# Stepwise

Stepwise is a minimalist to-do and goal-tracking app designed to help users make steady progress through small, intentional steps.

Inspired by the idea that meaningful journeys are built incrementally, Stepwise focuses on clarity, simplicity, and momentum rather than overwhelming task lists.

## ✨ Features

- Create and manage tasks as clear, actionable steps
- Organize tasks around goals or personal journeys
- Clean and distraction-free interface
- Built with SwiftUI for modern iOS experiences
- Designed for focus, not overload

## 🎯 Philosophy

Progress does not need to be rushed.
Stepwise encourages consistency and reflection, helping users move forward one step at a time.

Instead of asking *“How much is left?”*, Stepwise asks *“What is the next step?”*
